# Hi Ya'll
Hello All.  As anyone who has signed up for github this is my first change to the repository.  
I've named it hello-world2, as my first respository I made Private and have not found out how to change it to public yet.
So I've created a second repository named hello-world2
I want to use github to attempt to find and use scripts in my MSP business.
I am not a coder, but may do some learning while I'm here.
Let's see how this goes.
